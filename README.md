# MatScattnlay

This code is a MATLAB version of the scattnlay program described by Pena and Pal 
Computer Physics Communications 180 (2009) 2348-2354

The motivation for this version is to make it easier to extend with new features and to make sure that the algorithms are understood (by me) and tested
